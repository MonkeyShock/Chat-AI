# ChatBot using Brain.js

# How the files works ?

So we have three files with js, one for a small data "trainwithlowdata.js", the second are specific for a huge data but I don't specified the output "train.js", and the third file call "AI.js" this project take the input "human1" and output "human2" the file "humanchat.txt", however the "train.js " I recommend you put the input for a better answer, the input and the hiddenLayers are great and important the AI create a sentence, so are necessary have a database for a human conversation and the pronouns, this are hard if you do it.

Obs: Be carefull with the low quality and using a hiddenLayers, if you use with poor quality and not enough information in your database, the Artificial Inteligence will mix the words,
Exemple: "Hi", "Ih" or "How are you", "uyo rea ohw".

If you have just a phrases on your database you can take out the hiddenLayers, but you need to put the output for a better experince.
